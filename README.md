# Py-Lambdas Code Challenges

> The best way to learn to code is by doing it!

Welcome to the Py-Lambdas Code Challenges Page. 

These are code challenges and mini coding projects created by our Py-Lambdas community.

## Q&A

### How do I get started?
Fork this repository and start coding away! Test your solution by running the associated unit test. When you are reading to submit, submit a Pull Request with your solution.

### Can I help you out with code reviewing?
Absolutely! All challenges have associated unit tests to check if the code is correct or not. However, we would love any help in manual code review when possible! We want this to be a *community effort*.
