# Py-Lambdas Code Challenges

> The best way to learn to code is by doing it!

Welcome to the Py-Lambdas Code Challenges Page. 

These are code challenges and mini coding projects created by our Py-Lambdas community.

⚠️ Note: Construction ahead!! This is a work in progress and will be continually updated.

## Q&A

### How do I get started?
Fork this repository and start coding away!🚀 Test your solution by running the associated unit test. When you are reading to submit, submit a Pull Request to the [submissions](https://github.com/Py-Lambdas/code-challenges/tree/submissions) branch with your solution.

### How do I check my code?
Within the directory of your code challenge, run the following command for unit testing:

```
python -m unittest discover
```

### Can I help you out with code reviewing?
Absolutely! All challenges have associated unit tests to check if the code is correct or not. However, we would love any help in manual code review when possible! We want this to be a *community effort*.

### Can I add code challenges?
Yes! Please submit a Pull Request to the [challenges](https://github.com/Py-Lambdas/code-challenges/tree/challenges) branch with any challenges you want to add. All code challenges must include a unit test file (make sure your tests pass first!)

Code challenges should be written in the following format:

```python3

"""
Challenge: # Description of code challenge
Difficulty: # Expected difficulty level (Very Easy -> Expert)

Examples:
# Example 1
# Example 2
# Example 3

Author: # Your GitHub handle here
"""


def function_name():
    pass # Your code here

```

Prior to submitting, please run your code through [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to standardize formatting.

### Can I get help if I am stuck?
Yes! Reach out on Discord for any help you may need!

### What if I find an issue/bug in a challenge?
Submit all issues [here](https://github.com/Py-Lambdas/code-challenges/issues). Issue submissions should include specific filename and the problem. If you have a solution for the bug, include that as well! 😀
