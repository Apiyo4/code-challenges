Erase the text from here to the start of the `References` heading replace it with as detailed a request as possible. Some great things to include would be:

- The specific python topic or standard library module you're trying to learn more about
- Reasons you've found it difficult to learn currently
- What level you think the challenge would fall under (i.e. 100, 200, etc.)

### References

Replace the text in this section with a list of links that illustrate the thing you're trying to learn. We'd especially like:

- Links to the official Python documentation
- Links to specific block of code in a code base that you found confusing
- Links to medium articles, blog posts, or other media that talks about this module/topic but that you've found difficult to grasp.

Remember, this repository is _specifically_ about Python and its standard library, if the challenge would require you to pip install anything, it's likely not something we're going to want to put in this particular repository.
